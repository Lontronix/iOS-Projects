# iOS Projects Showcase
A showcase of the iOS apps I have worked on.


## [Word-Play](https://github.com/Lontronix/Word-Play)
Word-Play is a mad-libs like game that I made while I was a senior teacher for an iOS App Development class in High School. I did all of the UI programmatically so I could better understand how Constraints work. In this app I played around with Attributed Strings. After you input Nouns, Verbs and Adjectives you'll see the story with your input bolded. This was done using Attributed Strings

## [Final Grade Calculator](https://github.com/Lontronix/Final-Grade-Calculator)
Final grade calculator is an app for high school students that allows them to keep track of what grade they need to receive on a final in order to earn a certain grade in a class. It also lets them keep track of when their final is. I used Core Data to allow data to persist even if the app is closed.


## [Tic-Tac-Toe](https://github.com/Lontronix/Tic-Tac-Toe)

I created Tic-Tac-Toe when I senior taught iOS App Development in high school. I challenged myself to do all of the UI programmatically rather than relying on the storyboard. This help me better understand how layout constraints function and the life cycle of view controllers.

## [Deerfield Food Pantry](https://github.com/Lontronix/Deerfield-Food-Pantry)

Deerfield Food pantry is an app that I helped with when I was a member of the coding for a cause club at my high school. I made the *Food Pantry* & *About* screens.
